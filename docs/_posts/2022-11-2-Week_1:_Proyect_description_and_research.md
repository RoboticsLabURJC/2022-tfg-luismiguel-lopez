# Week 1: Project description and general research.

This first week job has been focused mainly on understanding and discussing a good topic to orientate the project and do some general research on it.

## Topic: Autonomous driving based on reinforcement learning.

In this TFG we will be attempting to create a simulated ecosystem where a car can drive autonomously in a track using reinforcement learning. The main focus of this project is to program, train and analyze the results of a model and compare it to different approaches of autonomous driving, showing the advantages and disadvantages of this model. 

We will be using an enviroment similar to the one the [AWS DEEPRACER](https://aws.amazon.com/es/deepracer/) competition uses. We will be focused on the model of the car, using similar sensors and actuators to the one the [actual car](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JMHRKQG) uses. 

## General research

In this first week we have visited lots of sites looking for information related with the robot. The main objective was to find a track world and an appropiate car model to create a simulation and be able to start proggraming. The models found were the following:
